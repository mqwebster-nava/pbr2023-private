title: Diversity, equity, and inclusion at Nava
lead: |
  To build digital services that are simple, effective, and accessible to all, our teams must reflect the diverse communities we serve across the US.
introduction: |
  Improving access to government services is essential to rebuilding trust in institutions, strengthening our democracy, and creating a more just society — especially for vulnerable populations.

  Our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity not only reflects our [values](/values) as a [public benefit corporation](/impact) but also enriches our ability to do this work. By striving to represent all of the people in the US, we’re better equipped to meet our social responsibility to all of the people we serve. And while we’ve made [progress](/public-benefit-reports/2020) in strengthening our team, we still have work to do.

  ## Majority BIPOC by 2025

  By 2025, we hope Nava better matches the representation of race and ethnicity in the US by comprising majority Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. To make progress towards that goal over the next year, our leadership team and employee resource groups are working together to build a process for identifying, prioritizing, and addressing inequities across the company.

    ## Support & community

    To help create a welcoming environment where people feel respected and valued, Nava supports several affinity groups. Each Employee Resource Group (ERG) is created by employees to provide community, mentorship, and support. ERGs have annual budgets, organize internal and external activities, and ERG Leads meet monthly with the Executive team to track initiatives and discuss feedback. ERGs contribute to critical conversations about how we can grow as a public benefit corporation and a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace.

## Explore the data

Numbers help us track progress but they don’t tell a complete story about the experiences, perspectives, and intersectional identities represented at Nava. To give a sense of how Nava grows and changes, we collect data annually. The way we collect and use data is anonymous, transparent, and consensual. Read more in our [methodology post](https://blog.navapbc.com/sharing-de-i-data-navas-methodology-27ca4dfc69f2).

The data below was collected on February 5, 2021 and 83 percent of the team responded.

To try and provide a more accurate representation of race, ethnicity, and gender, the survey allowed people to describe themselves in their own terms, choose more than one option, and/or decline to answer.
