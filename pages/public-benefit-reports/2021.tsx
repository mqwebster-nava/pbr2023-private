              intro:
                "Veterans who file claims to receive benefits to cover certain health issues can sometimes get stuck in a waiting pattern. Nava is working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of the CTO’s (OCTO) Benefits Delivery Team to build tools that reduce the amount of time it takes to process a Veterans’ disability benefits claim. We envision a future where Veterans hear back about benefits claims in days instead of months, ensuring that they and their families receive the healthcare they need in a timely manner.",
              full: "To speed up the handling of these claims, we developed a prototype to process one specific disability claim – hypertension – and released it to a small number of claims in order to learn from and continually iterate on the prototype. We started with a prototype called the Hypertension Fast Tracker that allowed some Veterans’ claims for hypertension disability benefits to be processed in days instead of months. \n Through our research into the claims adjudication process, we discovered that requiring Veterans to complete duplicative, unnecessary medical exams in order to get a claim approved contributed to the delay. We hypothesized that by introducing Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) health evidence to VA claims benefits adjudicators, we could help reduce unnecessary medical exams when possible and decrease the times Veterans spend waiting for a claim decision. \n We approached this project by deciding to narrow the scope dramatically to quickly release a prototype to a small number of claims. Our prototype addressed one disability type for a subset of one type of claim, and was used several times a day by one or two pilot participants. By starting with such a dramatically slow rollout, we can learn and iterate the prototype based on how it performs. This is a crucial step in an evolving technology landscape like the VA’s where systems are continually upgraded. Both OCTO and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) supported and fostered the kind of environment where we could release and continually improve these small prototypes. \n We went on to expand the prototype, now called the Rapid Ready for Decision program, to asthma claims, and are evaluating new claims for suitability as well. The measurably positive outcomes we have observed are a testament to the strength of our small scale, iterative approach and the use of prototypes when introducing new digital software. \n The initial prototype, the Hypertension Fast Tracker, was released in December 2021, and allowed some Veterans’ claims for hypertension disability benefits to be processed in days instead of months. So far, processing times using our prototypes have averaged 3-5 days for claims that don’t need exams and 25 days for those that do. That’s compared to 80 to 100 days on average. Even with our low volume of claims, we’ve saved Veterans over 5000 days of waiting for a decision this quarter. \n These are small outcomes, but that’s intentional. Our approach is to deliver value more quickly by starting small and learning through prototyping and iteration. Keeping this in mind, these outcomes are good indicators that are helping us learn and evolve our prototype. Our work is both serving veterans and providing knowledge generation for sustainable, repeatable processes in the VA’s future.",

In tandem with this work, we built the API integration layer to connect multiple state systems with paidleave.mass.gov and other paid family and medical leave systems.",

We launched this project with several pilots. In a pilot, we incrementally develop pieces of the end-to-end experience and test them with real users (pilot participants) before the service launches to the public. This helps us identify and mitigate risks early on so we can affirm that what we ultimately deliver works for users, integrates with downstream systems, and collects the information needed to meet program goals. In a multi-vendor environment with a strict legislative deadline, pilots also serve as milestones for teams to align on so we can collaboratively build and validate new features.  For our first pilot, we designed and built an application that allowed claimants to create an account, log in, verify an account, reset the password, log out, and take the first steps toward creating a claim. We also tested a key technical integration with the Department of Revenue (DOR), which provides contribution and wage data that is essential to determining a claimant's eligibility. In the second and third pilots, we expanded the application to allow claimants to submit an application and ensured that Massachusetts administrators receive the complete and accurate data needed to adjudicate a claim. Building and testing piece-by-piece, over multiple pilots, also allows us to test the application with a diverse set of participants to further ensure that it’s simple and easy to use for everyone. In one testing session, we discovered a loophole where participants were stuck because they were unable to reset their password. This was important because we learned from other states with PFML programs that password resets are a primary cause of high call volume at call centers. We knew that creating a simple self-service reset password flow would reduce the burden on the call center, saving staff time and resources. In this case, a participant mistyped their email address when completing the flow for resetting their password. We updated the flow to allow users to fix a mistyped email address and still successfully reset their password.  Pilots let us discover unforeseen and unpredictable errors like these in a low-risk environment, before they become a barrier to claimants and a burden to staff. In this first pilot, we were able to build and test the first steps of the account creation process — an essential part of the user experience — with real users.  This particular pilot was our first step in building Massachusetts’ brand new Paid Family Medical Leave (PFML) program at paidleave.mass.gov. Since we launched in 2021, the program has paid out nearly $600 million in benefits programs to over 90,000 people who were experiencing a big life event. We built digital tools for both claimants and employers using the program, helping to make managing paid leave simple for all. Our shared goal is to ensure that workers, families, and employers in the Commonwealth will be able to confidently navigate life’s critical moments. "

Above all, we aimed to make receiving messages as simple as possible for beneficiaries with minimal resources; to instill increased confidence in CMS; and to feel like they’re being taken care of on a personal level. We had a lot of big ideas when it came to what we wanted the message center to provide, but most came down to the idea of using data to unlock more personalized healthcare for beneficiaries. First and foremost, we wanted to help them plan their healthcare, manage coverage and manage costs. We also endeavored to make sure beneficiaries were able to manage any chronic conditions, keep track of their prescriptions, and crucially, build trust in the care CMS provides. Utilizing the information that CMS already has about beneficiaries and their medical needs, we set out to use that information to provide value to the beneficiary beyond just confirmations of payment. For example, this year beneficiaries will receive an email immediately after enrolling in a new plan to make them feel certain they’ll be getting the appropriate care. We believe providing clear and timely feedback improves the self-service experience. "

They can help communicate to claimants where their unemployment or healthcare claim stands, building trust and reducing the need for burdensome interactions, such as calling a contact center. Claims trackers are a familiar feature in the private sector, from package tracking to pizza delivery apps. In an increasingly digital world, many have come to expect these kinds of self-service, private sector experiences in the public benefits space.",
